# Changelog

### v2.0.0

- Switched to semantic versioning of the binaries.
- The default value of persist-flags has been changed from `true` to `false`.
  This value can be overriden in MODULE file of a project or in the user's configuration.
  The former takes precedence.
- Updated the minimum required Go dependency to 1.18.
